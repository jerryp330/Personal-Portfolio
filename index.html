            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p> Thanks to over two years of both personal and academic coding experience, I am skillful in full-stack web development,
                machine learning, data analysis, version control, and computational logic. Alongside these skills, I am very capable in using 
                languages and frameworks such as Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, MySQL, and React. I am a hard worker and dedicated learner, so
                I plan on learning much more! Not to mention, I am also a team player with plenty of experience coding with small and large teams.

            <p class = "cstock">Here is a hackathon project I worked on alongside a team of five. CompanyStocker is a simple interactive application
                developed using Python and a custom version of Python's Tkinter module. The program prompts the user to input any ticker 
                symbol of their choice and returns a page displaying detailed information regarding the company's stock.
                Feel free to demo the program or take a look at the code!
