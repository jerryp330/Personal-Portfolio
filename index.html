            <h1> About Me </h1>
            <p> Thanks to over two years of both personal and academic coding experience, I am skillful in full-stack web development,
                machine learning, data analysis, version control, and computational logic. Alongside these skills, I am very capable in using 
                languages and frameworks such as Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, MySQL, and React. I am a hard worker and dedicated learner, so
                I plan on learning much more! Not to mention, I am also a team player with plenty of experience coding with small and large teams.
